# Hexo incremental id

I can eat glass, it doesn't hurt me.

A script that adds an incremental id to __all your pages__, for those who prefer using fixed ids in permalink.

__Attention!__ This script will scan all your markdown files under `sources` folder, and all the methods are synchronous, you may encounter
+ performance problems
+ some old md files modified because a missing id is saved

## FAQ
### This script is ugly
I agree with you. if you have better / elegant way to handle a unique incremental id, please contact me.

### No test?
Yes, no test. I've wasted several hours reading hexo docs and writing this script, I can't afford more. And this script is so brute-force that no one is supposed to use it, except me.
